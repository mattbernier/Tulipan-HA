"""Sensor definitions for the EG4 Web Monitor integration.

This subpackage contains sensor type definitions and configurations for
all entity types in the integration.

Submodules (to be populated during refactoring):
- types: SensorConfig TypedDict definition
- inverter: Main SENSOR_TYPES dictionary
- mappings: Field mappings and sensor lists
- gridboss: GridBOSS sensor definitions
- station: Station/plant sensor definitions
